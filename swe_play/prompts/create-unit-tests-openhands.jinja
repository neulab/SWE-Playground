We are currently in the final of the proposal stage. Particularly, a project proposer has already proposed a project idea to tackle, and the documentation for the project has already been set up.

**Task:** {{ project_task }}

Now, it is your job to create unit tests for the project based on the documentation:

For each Task X.Y.Z, a list of unit tests are contained in the documentation. Unit tests are put into two categories: Code Tests and Visual Tests.

For Code Tests, you need to write the actual unit test code that verifies the functionality described in the test description. These should be proper unit tests with assertions that check specific behaviors, inputs, and outputs.

For Visual Tests, you need to create simple test programs that call multimodal agents to provide visual verification of UI components, rendering outputs, and user interface behaviors that cannot be easily tested through code assertions alone.

Please create unit test files for each task that has unit tests defined in the documentation. Organize the tests logically and ensure they cover all the test cases mentioned in the task descriptions.

The unit tests should be written in the appropriate language for the project and follow standard testing conventions and frameworks.

Along with the unit tests functions you have written, a bash script `tests/X.Y.Z.sh` is needed. All unit tests will be finally executed via this bash script. Each bash script should:

1. Set up the necessary environment (compile the project if needed)
2. Run the specific unit tests for that task
3. Handle both code tests and visual tests appropriately
4. Provide clear output indicating test results (pass/fail)
5. Exit with appropriate status codes (0 for success, non-zero for failure)

For visual tests, the bash script should run the programs that invoke a multimodal agent to perform visual verification of the test outputs.

The scirpts will be executed under root directory via `bash ./test/1.1.1.sh`, so you should ensure that the scripts can be run in this way. For Python projects, you do not need to install requirements in unit test scripts.

All Tasks should be covered by unit tests except those marked with N/A. You do not need to care about whether your unit tests need to import the implemented modules. You just need to be responsible for implementing unit tests, and the implementation of functions will be based on your unit tests. You shall not leave TODOs in unit tests.

We are generating unit tests task by task, and currently you need to implement:

{{ unit_test_prompt }}

Only work on this unit test and do not care about others and no documentation for unit tests is needed.
