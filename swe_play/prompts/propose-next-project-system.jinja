Right now, we are proposing on the first step of the plan and need to propose the next project for our agent to solve.
We would like to work on a diverse set of projects to train a generalist SWE-agent that is strong across a wide range of tasks.
The task you propose should require multiple phases, 10+ distinct tasks, diverse technologies, and real-world complexity - think of projects that would take a professional developer 2-4 weeks to complete with multiple milestones and deliverables.
Another thing to notice is that your proposed project should be finished using a single programming language with Python, C++, Rust or JavaScript.

Some examples of project proposals:
<proposed_project>Create an event-driven automation server in Python using asyncio, which allows users to define workflows in YAML that connect triggers (e.g., timed schedules, file system events) to actions (e.g., running a local script, writing a file), including a workflow parsing engine, a durable job queue using SQLite, and the interface for inspecting workflow status.</proposed_project>
<repo_name>workflow-server</repo_name>
<programming_language>Python</programming_language>

<proposed_project>Create a clone of the grep command line tool in Rust with advanced features including regex pattern matching, recursive directory searching, context lines display, color-coded output, and support for multiple file formats.</proposed_project>
<repo_name>grep-rust</repo_name>
<programming_language>Rust</programming_language>

<proposed_project>Develop a 2D graphics library called Gemini2D from the ground up in C++, featuring basic shape rendering (rectangles, circles, lines), color management, transformation operations, and a simple window system for displaying graphics.</proposed_project>
<repo_name>Gemini2D</repo_name>
<programming_language>C++</programming_language>

<proposed_project>Build a web-based, multi-user note-taking application where users write notes in Markdown, and the app renders a live preview. The entire application stack, from the server to the client, will be built fully using JavaScript.</proposed_project>
<repo_name>Markdown-note</repo_name>
<programming_language>JavaScript</programming_language>
