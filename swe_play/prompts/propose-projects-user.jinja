Please propose exactly {{ num_projects }} diverse projects for the agent to work on, along with names for each project repo.
Format your output as a list of exactly {{ num_projects }} projects, each in the following format:

Project 1:
<proposed_project>...</proposed_project>
<repo_name>...</repo_name>
<programming_language>...</programming_language>
<constraints>...</constraints>

Project 2:
<proposed_project>...</proposed_project>
<repo_name>...</repo_name>
<programming_language>...</programming_language>
<constraints>...</constraints>

... (continue for all projects)

Each proposed project should be **algorithmically complex and computationally challenging** with the following characteristics:
- **Algorithm-heavy**: Must implement complex algorithms, data structures, or computational methods from scratch
- **Core logic implementation**: Cannot be solved by simply using existing libraries - requires substantial custom logic
- **Multi-component architecture**: Systems with multiple interacting components and complex state management
- **Non-trivial data processing**: Complex parsing, transformation, analysis, or generation of data
- **Custom protocols/formats**: Implementation of interpreters, compilers, parsers, or custom communication protocols

**INTERFACE REQUIREMENT:**
- **Command-line interface only**: All projects must be operated via CLI with command-line arguments, flags, and text-based output
- **No GUI components**: Projects must not include graphical user interfaces, web interfaces, or visual components
- **Text-based interaction**: All input/output should be through files, command-line parameters, or terminal text
- **Scriptable and automatable**: CLI design should enable easy automation and testing

**LIBRARY CONSTRAINTS REQUIREMENT:**
Each project must include specific constraints in the <constraints> section about which libraries/frameworks cannot be used. These constraints should force developers to implement fundamental algorithms from scratch rather than using existing solutions. Examples:
- Computer algebra systems: "Cannot use numpy, scipy, or sympy"
- Machine learning: "Cannot use TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn"
- Cryptography: "Cannot use existing crypto libraries like cryptography or pycrypto"
- Database engines: "Cannot use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or any existing database libraries"

**CLEAR SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENT:**
Each project must be clearly defined with specific, concrete requirements that enable comprehensive test case development:
- **Specific input/output formats**: Clearly define expected inputs and outputs with exact formats
- **Concrete functionality**: Detailed description of what the system should do with specific behaviors
- **Measurable performance criteria**: Include specific performance requirements, benchmarks, or constraints
- **Testable behavior**: Well-defined behaviors that can be verified through unit tests and integration tests
- **Unambiguous success criteria**: Clear definition of what constitutes a successful implementation
- **Edge case handling**: Explicit requirements for error conditions, boundary cases, and failure modes

All projects should use Python as the programming language. Projects should focus on implementing sophisticated computational systems with well-defined, testable specifications accessible only through CLI.

**DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT:**
Ensure maximum diversity across the 50 projects by:
- **Distributing across complexity areas**: Include projects from each of the complexity areas listed above, not clustering around just a few areas
- **Varying system types**: Mix low-level systems, high-level algorithms, and mid-level tools
- **Different problem domains**: Include projects spanning various domains
- **Balanced complexity focus**: Some projects should focus on data structures, others on algorithms, others on system design, others on mathematical computation
- **Avoid repetition**: Each project should address distinctly different computational challenges and use cases

**AVOID** (these are too simple, too vague, or inappropriate):
- Basic CRUD applications or simple data management
- Standard desktop/web apps without algorithmic complexity  
- File processing tools using standard libraries
- Simple wrappers around existing libraries
- Projects primarily focused on UI with minimal logic
- Basic automation scripts or simple utilities
- Vague or ambiguous project descriptions that don't specify concrete requirements
- Any projects requiring GUI, web interfaces, or visual components such as computer graphics related tasks
- Any projects requiring non-textual elements such as images or files as input and output
- Any projects aiming at some open-ended problems and implementation correctness cannot be easily evaluated  

Generate the projects as you are required. You are encouraged to be more creative and propose some projects that are not among the recommendation types.
