Tasks for the project:

{{ tasks_prompt }}

All of the proposed unit tests:

{{ previous_unit_tests }}

Now you should propose the detailed unit tests for:
{{ unit_test_prompt }}

You only need to propose the unit tests and do not need to implement them. You should describe:

1. **Test Case Name and Purpose**: A clear, descriptive name for each test case and what specific functionality it verifies.

2. **Test Scenarios**: Cover different scenarios including:
   - Normal/happy path cases
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling and exception cases

3. **Assertions**: Specify what should be verified/asserted in each test case.

Also, please also take previous unit tests into consideration. To be specific:

1. **Avoid Duplication**: Ensure the new unit tests don't duplicate existing test cases. Review the previous tests to understand what has already been covered.

2. **Consider Dependencies**: Be aware of how the new functionality interacts with previously tested components and ensure integration points are properly tested.

3. **Ensure No Conflicts**: Make sure the new tests won't interfere with or break existing test cases.

Please provide comprehensive test coverage that ensures the reliability and correctness of the implementation. Be precise with your output.
