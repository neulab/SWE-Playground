Please propose a single next project for the agent to work on and a name for the project repo.
Format your output as:
<proposed_project>...</proposed_project>
<repo_name>...</repo_name>
<programming_language>...</programming_language>
The proposed project should form a closed loop, meaning it could be self-contained without requiring any external dependencies, such as calls to external APIs or services. All necessary components and resources should be included within the project itself to ensure full autonomy and reproducibility.
