I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {{ workspace_dir_name }}. Here is your task:

Here is your task:

  You need to complete the implementations for all functions (i.e., those with pass statements) and pass the unit tests.

  Do not change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code like unit tests, etc.

  When you generate code, you must maintain the original formatting of the function stubs (such as whitespaces), otherwise we will not able to search/replace blocks for code modifications, and therefore you will receive a score of 0 for your generated code.

Here is the command to run the unit tests:
<test_command>
pytest .
</test_command>

Make a local git commit for each agent step for all code changes. If there is not change in current step, do not make a commit.
